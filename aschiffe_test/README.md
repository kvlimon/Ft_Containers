Accuracy and precision

Precision and accuracy are two ways that scientists think about error. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. Precision refers to how close measurements of the same item are to each other.

Therefore to check the equality of my data between my STL and the original we will use the accuracy by creating a series of hazardous data & operations by applying the same to both containers.

Precision comes into play especially when we are going to try to deduce the complexity of time, we will have to apply exactly the same operations on the two containers a large number of times in order to have a sample and calculate the average speed.
